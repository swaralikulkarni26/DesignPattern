SOLID Principles:
 
S-Single Ownership Principle-The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
O-Open and closed Principle-The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
L-Liskov Substitution-The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
I-Interface Segregation Principle-Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.
D-Dpendancy Inversion-The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
